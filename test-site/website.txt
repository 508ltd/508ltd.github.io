My heart belong to a Doberman,
A protector and a friend-
Intelligent and daring,
Devoted to the end.

So sleek and quick,
On constant watch,
A dog that earns your praise-
Yet with a heart of purest gold,
And gentle, loving ways.

So noble and reliable,
A winner from the start.
When I saw a Doberman,
I quickly lost my heart.
